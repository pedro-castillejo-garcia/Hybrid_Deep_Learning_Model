# Hybrid Deep Learning Model

### Author: Pedro Castillejo Garcia

This is a Hybrig Deep Learning Model that creates a SOM that identifiy frauds in bank and then combine the results with the unsupervised learning model. 
In this case the unsupervised learning model is an Artificial Neural Network which will take as inputs the results given by the SOM. The final result is the probability with which every customer commited fraud.
